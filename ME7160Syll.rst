Instructor

Prerequisites
=============

ME 4210/6210: Engineering Vibration or Equivalent

Time and Location
=================

Tuesday/Thursday, 5 PM - 6:20 PM. 146 RC Russ Center

Homework (10%)
==============

Homework will be posted online. Homework
problem solutions are collected every Thursday. You will be given no
less than one week to do them. If there is a test scheduled on a day
homework is due, the homework will be collected the following class
period. Each homework problem is nominally worth 1 point. More difficult
problems may be weighted accordingly. Your final homework score is your
average total score divided by the total number of possible points. You
are encouraged to work together in small groups, but keep in mind that
homework is assigned in order to help you learn and keep up with the
course material. If you can’t do the homework, you can’t do the exams.
Please see me if you need help with the homework. This class is a
cooperative effort between you and me. You are also encouraged to do
additional problems out of the text for practice.

Project (30%)
==============
Three projects (greater than HW), including programming will be
assigned during the semester. You will be required to turn in your
project via Github by setting up an account and becoming (nominally) a
contributer to my repository. You will create your own folder (with
your name) in the repository. Further instructions/demonstration will
follow. You must create an account on Github within the first week,
become a contributer to it, and learn how to check out
`the github respository`_. The respository is likely to become private after the
first week, which means that if you are not a member, you will not be
accepted. 

Exams (60%)
===========

There will be two midterms and a final exam graded on a straight, scale
(:math:`\geq 90 = A,\geq 80 = B, \geq 70 = C, \geq 60 = D, < 59 = F`).
The final exam will count for two test grades. The lowest exam grade of
the four will be dropped. An 8.5 in. by 11 in. formula sheet may be used
provided there are no derivations, definitions or solved problems on the
sheet. Tests will be graded and returned as soon as possible. Solutions
will be discussed during the lecture following the exam if time permits.
All grading discrepancies must be brought up in writing no later than
one week after the exam is returned. A simple note describing your
contentions will do.

Web Resources

You can find notes for the class, syllabus, and other materials posted on the `the github respository`_.

If you set this up properly, you will receive automatic emails of any
changes. You will even see the course notes as they develop. 


Software
========

Use what you are comfortable with. I will not be able to help you with
syntax, but I can help with fundamental concepts. My favorite codes for
this course are (in order): `Python`_,
`MATLAB <http://www.wright.edu/cats/software/products.html#matlab>`__
(free for registered WSU CECS students) (and its clone
`Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__). Any of these
languages that you are comfortable in will suffice.
